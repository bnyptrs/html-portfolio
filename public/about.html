<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Benny Peters. At the moment, I am a teacher at a Christian school.
  Apart from teaching at the school, I also do locksmith work, such as opening doors,
  rekeying locks, and duplicating keys. I am very interested in learning new things,
  and I am currently learning how to program websites. I would gladly do some work for you.
  If you need more information, you can find how to contact me
